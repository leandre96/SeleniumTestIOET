# SeleniumTestIOET

In my solution I created a Python class called 'CareerCatalogPage' which works using the webdriver known as 'browser' and a URL of the page. It has the method called 'load' which loads the Url to the webdriver and 'quit' that calls the quit method of the webdriver
Also I created a method called 'create_list_career' in which I get all the div with the className of 'panel panel-panel' then it uses a for loop to get the corresponding data from 'ul', 'li', 'a' texts elements.
Finally I created a Python file  in which I start the test and finally creating the corresponding csv file with the specifications.
